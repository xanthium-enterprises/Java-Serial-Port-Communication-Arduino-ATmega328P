# Serial Port Communication tutorial using Java and Arduino (ATmega328P)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- In this tutorial we will learn how to program serial port of a windows PC using Java programming language.

- The PC will communicate with an Arduino connected to the USB virtual Serial port of the PC and exchange text information using a Java program.

- Java Standard library no longer carries classes to communicate with the PC serial port,So we will use a third party library to code our program.
